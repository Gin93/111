All of the problem instances can be solved within 5s by my code. 


---------------------------------
How I solved the largest problem
--------------------------------
In question 1, I didn't create a variable whose format just like the output format. I create two matrix to represent the amount of goods for each truck delivering to each
customers,then output the result following the required format.  Personally, I think this way is faster than creating a variable following the output format.

So in question 2, I kept using the above two matrix, but I also created a matrix following the output format in order to calculate the sequences. My idea is enforcing the 
Minizinc to satisfy that two matrix firstly, then assign the value to the rest matrix. I find a way can do that: in the output, if I tried to output that two martrix, 
Minizicn tend to satisfy that firstly. So I wrote

	[if fix(deliverychilled [i,j]) = 0 then "" else "" endif | i in customers,j in trucks] ++
	[if fix(deliveryambient [i,j]) = 0 then "" else "" endif | i in customers,j in trucks] ++

they will NEVER be outputed,but it can make the program satisfy them firstly.
